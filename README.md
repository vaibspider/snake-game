This program is a popular Snake game.
This is a very basic version.
It lacks many important features.
So, these are the todo tasks :- 

TODO:
1. Increase the length of the snake by 1, if it captures the target.
2. Allow snake to be turned at any point of time.(allow fully zigzag motion)
3. Fix GAME OVER bug. (Even if the snake touches the terminal wall, in some cases, GAME OVER is not printed)
4. Apply dynamic checks for terminal window size.
5. Re-organize the code. Make it modular. Use best (standard) practices. Document it properly.
6. Find any other bugs and fix them.
7. Make it colorful and interesting. Show Game Score on the screen.
